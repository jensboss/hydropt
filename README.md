# dynprog
dynprog is a dynamic prgrogramming tool for the optimization of hydro power plants. It comprises classes to model power plants, their basins and turbines as well as to define scenarios with constraints.

Different scenarios can easily be compared with each other to compute and evalutate opportunity costs. A typical use case would be to price constraints due to ancillary services commitments or machine outages.

## Installation

Run the following to install:

```bash
pip install dynprog
```
